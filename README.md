# Code Explanation Step by Step:
This project is talking about a step-by-step explanation of the provided code in Program.cs and how it works with the ASP.NET Core framework:

## Global Usings:

Common namespaces are imported globally to be used throughout the application.
## Builder Configuration:

WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args): Initializes a new instance of the builder for configuring web applications.
builder.Services.AddDbContext<DataContext>(options => { options.UseSqlServer(builder.Configuration.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection")); }): Configures Entity Framework Core to use SQL Server with a connection string from the configuration.
## Service Registration:

builder.Services.AddControllersWithViews(): Adds services for controllers and views.
builder.Services.AddRazorPages(): Adds Razor Pages services.
builder.Services.AddEndpointsApiExplorer() and builder.Services.AddSwaggerGen(): Configures Swagger for API documentation.
builder.Services.AddScoped<IProductService, ProductService>() and builder.Services.AddScoped<ICategoryService, CategoryService>(): Registers scoped services for dependency injection.
## Application Building:

var app = builder.Build(): Builds the configured web application.
## Swagger UI:

app.UseSwaggerUI(): Enables Swagger UI for API documentation.
## Environment Configuration:

if (app.Environment.IsDevelopment()) { app.UseWebAssemblyDebugging(); } else { app.UseExceptionHandler("/Error"); app.UseHsts(); }: Configures error handling and HSTS based on the environment.
## Middleware Configuration:

app.UseSwagger(): Enables Swagger middleware.
app.UseHttpsRedirection(): Redirects HTTP requests to HTTPS.
app.UseBlazorFrameworkFiles() and app.UseStaticFiles(): Serves Blazor framework files and static files.
app.UseRouting(): Adds routing middleware.
## Endpoint Mapping:

app.MapRazorPages(): Maps Razor Pages endpoints.
app.MapControllers(): Maps controller endpoints.
app.MapFallbackToFile("index.html"): Configures fallback for client-side routing in a single-page application.
## Run Application:

app.Run(): Runs the web application.
This setup follows ASP.NET Core best practices for configuring services, middleware, and endpoints, making it ready for development and production environments.
